## Introduction to the SRD
The **Rapture Roleplay System** was originally designed to be something completely different from its current rendition. In fact, it was meant to be a percentile dice (d%) system, but it never came to fruition as such. **Rapture Roleplay System** has since grown into a large-scale Breathless-based RPG, with plenty of rules-light philosophical underpinnings and an emphasis on playing worlds, not rules. Much of what you find here is the culmination of about three years’ worth of game design, setbacks, indie TTRPG inspirations, and a need to create something that suited the needs of newer players looking to break into TTRPGs.

This SRD, if you will, serves as a living document, a running snapshot of the **Rapture Roleplay System**, powering _The Adventurer’s Guide to Belleruta_ (forthcoming RPG), _Dragontown: A City of a Billion Lost Souls_, and _No One Owns the Sky_ produced and published by G. Michael Rapp (Free Radicals Press) and Tyler McAlister (Softcore Anarchy).

## What Are Roleplaying Games?
If you’re new to roleplaying games, this could be a daunting concept to understand. 

Don’t worry.

Roleplaying games are, at their very heart, easy to understand.

Roleplaying games are those games in which a group of players shares a collective narrative, with numerous challenges, character development, and exciting, pulse-pounding action. These collective narratives are guided by the referee (REF), who interprets dice rolls, applies rulings, and uses the inner storytelling genius we all possess toward specific milestones. The REF is not God. The other players should assist the REF in creating an exciting, enriching, and worthwhile gaming experience, which the REF should be willing to be part of from the get-go.

Roleplaying games require most individual players to take on a persona, who players have tailored for the game story they are playing within. For example, Pedyro "Quick Fingers" Wintson, a former bodyguard turned bandit leader, who loves good drinks and exquisite, exotic foods, might be the character you are playing within your **Rapture Roleplay System** campaign.

Playing Quick Fingers, we’ll use his nickname, for now, you will interact with your fellow players and their in-game personae, along with the REF and her non-player characters (NPCs). You might also interact with the story world, using dice rolls to determine the results of certain confrontations and work with your REF in how you will likely roleplay a given situation, progress forward, and accomplish what your character has set out to do in this collective world. In all, you are indistinguishable from Quick Fingers. Everything Quick Fingers wants, you want. Everything Billy does, you have a hand in from the get-go. When the referee interacts with you, it is usually on the basis that you are acting in the interests of your character, in-game, Pedyro "Quick Fingers" Wintson.
